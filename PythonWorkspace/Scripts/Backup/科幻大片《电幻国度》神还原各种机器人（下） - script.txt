One of the things that <break time="3s" /> I think is so cool <break time="3s" /> about your lab is that, <break time="3s" /> you know, in addition to <break time="3s" /> creating these really ambitious humanoid <break time="3s" /> robots, you also have robots <break time="3s" /> that have really novel forms. <break time="3s" /> <break time="3s" />
